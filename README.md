## Instructions
1. Write your contract in [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org).  
2. Open `src/index.html` in the [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) browser, make sure you have [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) installed.  
3. Deploy your contract from Remix or from the "Deploy Contract" form on the Dapp to the network of your choosing (we're using Rinkeby).  
4. Interact with your contract!

## Development
If you'd like to run the `lite-server` development server for front-end hot reloading, install dependencies and run the dev task with the following terminal commands:
  ```javascript
  $ npm install
  $ npm run dev
  ```

The app will be served at [localhost:3001](http://localhost:30001).
